* The passes of a Compiler (Fig 1-1, p2). I'm leaving the masm related off since I don't use it. Hopefully that won't bother ~~my mancrush~~ retired Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. :D
    * *Program,		Function*
    * cc,		Driver program
    * cpp, C preprocessor (pass 1)
    * c0, C compiler pass2
    * c1, C compiler pass3
    * c2, C compiler pass4
    * as, Assembler
    * ld, Linker
