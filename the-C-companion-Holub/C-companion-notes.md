### Notes, Holub's "The C companion"

* Alignment: Chapter 3 has an ingenious analogy of word alignment to explain why even boundaries are needed by comparing it to storing a number on facing pages of a book.

* Makin' some ~~copies~~ code snippets...
```javascript
function test() {
 console.log("look maâ€™, no spaces");
}
```

```C
void main() {
	int sq(int x) { return x * x; }
	return sq(3);
}
```

```Scheme
(define (sq x) (* x x))
(define (fourth x)
  (lambda (x) (sq (sq x))))
```

* Table example from adam-p's Markdown cheatsheet:

    | Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
Markdown | Less | Pretty

*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
